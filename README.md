# Buddy's default library

The standards and base applications a project starts from when it is created with Buddy and the organisation has no library of its own. An enterprise library has the same layout, in its own repository.

## Layout

```text
standards/
  general/        the rules every project follows, whatever its stack (evergreen)
  <profile>/      the rules of one stack (born with the project)
templates/
  <profile>/      the application a new project starts from
```

`buddy init` copies `standards/general/` and the chosen profile's standards into the project's `docs/standards/`, and the profile's template into the project's root, renamed for the project (`BuddyApp` and `buddy-app` are the placeholders). In a folder that already holds a project it copies the standards only. Its build and tests are run once, so the project is known to be born healthy.

## Profiles

| Profile | Standards | Template |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `empty` | general only | a truly empty project: README, `.gitignore`, `.editorconfig` and a `validate` that passes and says nothing is checked yet |
| `dotnet-react` | general and .NET + React | a .NET 10 minimal API with a health endpoint and its xUnit test, a React 19 + Vite + TypeScript page with its Vitest test, `npm run setup` and `npm run validate` |

A new profile adds a folder under `standards/` (when it has rules of its own) and under `templates/`, and a line in `library.json`, which is what Buddy shows the owner when they choose a profile.

## Two kinds of standards

Every standards file says its `lifecycle` in its front matter:
- `birth`: copied once when the project is created; from then on it belongs to the project, and its Standards Owner may change it. A later version of this library does not touch it.
- `evergreen`: owned by the library. The project keeps the version it was created from; when the library publishes a new version, the project is told what changed and its Standards Owner decides whether to move to it. A project that must depart from an evergreen rule records that as its own decision.

Each rule states its zone (`must`, `prefer`, `free`), how it is checked (a program first, then an independent reviewer, `declared` last) and the problem it prevents. A rule that cannot state these does not belong here.

## Versions

Versions are git tags (`v0.1.0`, …). A project records in `docs/standards/ORIGIN.md` the library, profile, version and commit it was created from.
